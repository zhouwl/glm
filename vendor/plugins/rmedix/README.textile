h2. What Is It?

*Rmedix* is a Rails plugin that presents an ActionView wrapper for rendering "Flowplayer":http://flowplayer.org and "FlexPaper":http://flexpaper.devaldi.com/default.jsp

"FlexPaper":http://flexpaper.devaldi.com/default.jsp is an open source light weight document viewer component designed to work together with libraries such as PDF2SWF, making it possible to display PDF files in Adobe Flex and other Flash based applications. 


h2. Getting Started

h3. Rails 3.x

@rails plugin install git://github.com/attractor/rmedix.git@

This will automatically setup  Rmedix for your rails application.

h2. How to use

Include javascript into layout or view file

@<%= javascript_include_tag :defaults, 'swfobject', 'flexpaper_flash', 'jquery' %>@

for flowplayer
@<%= javascript_include_tag :defaults, 'flowplayer-3.2.4.min', 'flowplayer.playlist-3.0.8.min', 'jquery' %>@


then In your views use it like

@<%= flowplayer() %>@
 or 
%div.clips.petrol{:style => "float:left"}     
      %a{:href =>"${url}"}                                  
        ${title}                                  
        %span ${subTitle}                         
        %em ${time}                               
    = flowplayer( {:flashvars => {                
          :baseUrl => "http://blip.tv/file/get",  
          :subTitle => "videos from blip"}}, @playlist)
